.ipnb notebook has been created in two different ways-1)azure machine learning studio-notebooks(as shown in demo video)
                                                      2)azure machine learning studio-compute-jupyter lab(download link is available above '3rd'point )
what each line of code does can be seen in main 'early stage diabetes prediction.ipnb'
summary:
Azure Machine Learning studio is a web portal in Azure Machine Learning that contains low-code and no-code options for project authoring and asset management. If you're a new user, choose Azure Machine Learning, instead of ML Studio (classic).
